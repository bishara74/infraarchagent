# InfraArchAgent

**A Multi-Agent System for Secure Cloud Infrastructure Generation from Natural Language**

This repository contains the implementation for my BSc thesis at
**Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE), Faculty of Informatics**.

## About the project

InfraArchAgent takes a plain-English description of the infrastructure you
need and produces three alternative Infrastructure-as-Code packages:
cost-optimised, performance-optimised and security-optimised. A pipeline of
LLM-driven agents plans the architecture, generates the files, scans them with
Checkov and tfsec, automatically fixes security violations, and validates the
result. A React interface shows each agent's progress live and lets the
engineer compare the packages, review every security fix as a diff, and
approve, retry or reject packages that still need a human decision.

## Status

🚧 Under active development as part of the thesis. See
[`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md) for progress and
[`docs/design-deviations.md`](docs/design-deviations.md) for where the
implementation differs from the thesis design.
