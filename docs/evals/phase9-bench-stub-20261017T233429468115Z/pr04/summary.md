# Phase 9 benchmark

Status: **PASS**

Mode: stub rehearsal; system overhead only.

Descriptive durations (seconds; no new thresholds):

| Stage | Count | Median | p90 | Maximum |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| deterministic_repairs | 0 | unknown | unknown | unknown |
| final_security_scan | 0 | unknown | unknown | unknown |
| final_validation | 0 | unknown | unknown | unknown |
| generation_gate | 0 | unknown | unknown | unknown |

| post_security_validation | 0 | unknown | unknown | unknown |
| security_iteration_verification | 0 | unknown | unknown | unknown |
| validation_repair_round | 0 | unknown | unknown | unknown |

Iteration outcomes: {'attempted_fix_iterations': 0, 'deadline_only_rollbacks': 0, 'deadline_before_candidate': 0, 'multiple_cause_deadline_rollbacks': 0, 'validity_regression_rollbacks': 0}.
Initialization: {'init_runs': 0, 'init_reused': 0, 'reinitializations': 0}.
Repair deadline stops (measured rounds): {}.
Historical 9d stops: four initial / nine post-security (separate historical evidence). A deadline-only rollback does not establish that the candidate would have passed verification.

pr04: {"count": 10, "median": 1.4159573645010823, "p90": 1.6525250210033846, "max": 1.6955894269995042}; failed/incomplete: 0.

pr04 threshold: PASS.

Measured known cost: $0.000000; unknown costs stay unknown.
